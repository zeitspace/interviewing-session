# How to plan, run, and learn from research interviews

Welcome to the **How to plan, run, and learn from research interviews** Zeitspace Session resource page. Let's make sure you're all set up.

If you didn't attend the session in person, you may want to [read the slide deck](https://github.com/zeitspace/interviewing-session/blob/main/Interviewing%20Zeitspace%20Session%20-%20Slide%20Deck.pdf) for a bit of background.

## Setup

* We are using Zoom as our online meeting platform. It doesn't take long to [install from their site](https://zoom.us/download).
* We'll share some exercise materials using Google Drive. To take advantage of these resources most easily, make sure you can [access Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).
* A pencil or pen, and some paper might be handy.

## Activity 1 - Interview Taboo

We have shared the [Interview Taboo activity guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xf1jGrtXwRq32hI5hZwYbm66f-fjllMWJdwqqXf0S08/edit?usp=sharing) as a view-only Google Doc.

[Interviewer guides are available](https://github.com/zeitspace/interviewing-session/tree/main/Interview%20Taboo) are also available. The interviewer guides provide the list of taboo words you need to avoid during the activity.

## Activity 2 - What was the question?
